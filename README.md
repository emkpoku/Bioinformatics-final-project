# Bioinformatics Final Project

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate what was learned in my semester long Introduction to Bioinformatics (MBBB301) course. The assignment required us to create a fully functioning R script in RStudio that can load packages, read data, and create objects without error. 

## Part 1 
In the first part of this project we were tasked with isolating the gene sequences of the E.coli lac operon. After isolating the non-coding regions of the genes and their introns, we created new sequences by binding together the coding regions of the lacZ, lacY, and lacA genes. Finally the R package BioStrings was used to translare the lacZ gene into an amino acid sequence. 

## Part 2
The second part of the project was focused on multiple sequence alignment. We were given a file with species names and accession numbers for a gene that was homologous across all the species. Multiple sequence alignment was used to find how the gene had changed over time. The MAFFT website (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) was used to perform teh multiple sequence alignment. Finally, a random sequence was generated to see what its effect would be on the alignment.
